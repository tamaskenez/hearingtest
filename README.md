# Hearing Test

Console application made with JUCE.

Usage: `hearingtest <output-file>`

Starts an interactive console application which tests the entire frequency range of the human hearing and outputs a MatLab text file with results.

Since there is no calibration, it can only be used to compare the results of different people or the results of the same people taken at different times (over the years).
